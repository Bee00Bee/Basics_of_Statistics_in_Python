In this repository, I discuss the basics of statistics such as mean, variance, outliers and etc which are calculated from a real datasets or synthetic data. There are two jupyter notebooks which you can follow as number 1, 2, 3, and etc. The names are: 
* Statistics_Fundamentals_1_Basic_Definitions.ipnyb
* Statistics_Fundamentals_2_Data_and_Zscores.ipnyb
* Statistics_Fundamentals_3_Data_visualization.ipnyb
* Statistics_Fundamentals_4_Distributions.ipnyb
* Statistics_Fundamentals_5_Regression.ipnyb

### Required packages:
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [scipy](https://scipy.org/)
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
